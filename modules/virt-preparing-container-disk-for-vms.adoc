= Preparing a container disk for virtual machines

You must build a container disk with a virtual machine image and push it to a container registry before it can used with a virtual machine. You can then either import the container disk into a PVC using a data volume and attach it to a virtual machine, or you can attach the container disk directly to a virtual machine as an ephemeral `containerDisk` volume.

[NOTE]
====
The size of a disk image inside a containerDisk is limited by the size of the maxium layer size of any registry where the containerDisk will be hosted.
For Red Hat Quay the default limit is 20GiB and can be configured using the `MAXIMUM_LAYER_SIZE` in the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_quay/3.5/html-single/manage_red_hat_quay/index#quay-schema[Red Hat Quay configuration].
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Large container images - and thus containerDisks - can lead to disk pressure on worker nodes and in the worst case lead to node unavailability.

.Prerequisites

* Install `podman` if it is not already installed.

* The virtual machine image must be either QCOW2 or RAW format.

.Procedure

. Create a Dockerfile to build the virtual machine image into a container image. The virtual machine image must be owned by QEMU, which has a UID of `107`, and placed in the `/disk/` directory inside the container. Permissions for the `/disk/` directory must then be set to `0440`.
+
The following example uses the Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) to handle these configuration changes in the first stage, and uses the minimal `scratch` image in the second stage to store the result:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ cat > Dockerfile << EOF
FROM registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/ubi:latest AS builder
ADD --chown=107:107 <vm_image>.qcow2 /disk/ <1>
RUN chmod 0440 /disk/*

FROM scratch
COPY --from=builder /disk/* /disk/
EOF
----
<1> Where <vm_image> is the virtual machine image in either QCOW2 or RAW format. +
To use a remote virtual machine image, replace `<vm_image>.qcow2` with the complete url for the remote image.

. Build and tag the container:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman build -t <registry>/<container_disk_name>:latest .
----

. Push the container image to the registry:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ podman push <registry>/<container_disk_name>:latest
----
